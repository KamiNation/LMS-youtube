### Explanation:

> Purpose of CatchAsyncError: This utility function is designed to simplify error handling in asynchronous route handlers. Instead of manually wrapping each async function in a try-catch block, you can use this function to automatically catch errors and pass them to your Express error-handling middleware.

### How It Works:

> CatchAsyncError takes an async function Func as an argument.
> It returns a new function that, when called with req, res, and next, will execute the Func function.
> Promise.resolve() ensures that even if Func is a synchronous function, it will still be treated as a promise.
> If Func throws an error or returns a rejected promise, catch(next) will pass the error to Express's next() function, triggering the error-handling middleware.

#### This pattern is common in Express applications to reduce boilerplate code and ensure consistent error handling across all async route handlers.


### Explanation:

> Purpose of ErrorMiddleware: This middleware is designed to handle and respond to errors that occur in your Express application. It catches various types of errors, such as invalid MongoDB ObjectId, duplicate keys, and issues related to JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and provides a standardized error response.

### How It Works:

The middleware first ensures that a default status code (500) and message (Internal server error) are set if they are not already defined in the error object.
It then checks the type of error using the err.name or err.code properties and customizes the error message and status code based on the specific error type.
The custom ErrorHandler utility is used to create consistent error objects.
Finally, the middleware sends a JSON response with the error's status code and message, which is sent back to the client to inform them of what went wrong.
This middleware should be added as the last middleware in your Express application so that it can catch any errors that were not handled by previous middlewares or routes.
